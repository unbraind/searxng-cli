/**
 * pm-kanban — first-party exemplar for shipping a complete project-management
 * *archetype* as an installable pm package, built on public SDK primitives only.
 *
 * Where {@link ../../../pm-command-kit | pm-command-kit} is the exemplar for the
 * `commands` capability, this package is the exemplar for the `schema` capability
 * *and* the project-profile model: it ships a self-contained "Kanban
 * continuous-flow" archetype that complements the three core-baked profiles
 * (agile/ops/research) without modifying core.
 *
 * Two surfaces, two consumers:
 *
 * 1. **Live schema** — `activate` registers the archetype's domain schema through
 *    the public registration API (`registerItemTypes`/`registerItemFields`).
 *    These are GLOBAL contributions, so the manifest
 *    deliberately declares no `activation.commands`: pm activates the package
 *    under its conservative tier for every command, making the `Card` type and
 *    flow fields available to `pm create`, `pm list --type Card`, and `pm validate`
 *    the moment the package is installed.
 * 2. **Profile spec** — {@link kanbanProfile} is a {@link ProjectProfileDefinition}
 *    describing the *complete* archetype (item types, custom statuses, fields, the
 *    `Card` workflow, offline search config, a starter template, and package
 *    recommendations). `activate` registers it through `api.registerProfile`, so
 *    once the package is installed it resolves by name through `pm profile list`,
 *    `pm profile show kanban`, and `pm profile apply kanban` — staging the
 *    non-schema dimensions (statuses/config/templates) idempotently exactly like a
 *    core archetype, with no consumer code required.
 *
 * The extension is intentionally pure: no filesystem, network, environment, or
 * process access — so its manifest declares `sandbox_profile: "strict"` with all
 * permissions false. Only types are imported from the published SDK specifier, so
 * the module loads without resolving the SDK at module-evaluation time when the
 * package is copied into an installed tracker.
